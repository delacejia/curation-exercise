      <div class="flavor-text">Peat pellets are compressed soil that can be hydrated for germinating seeds. 
        Chamomile is a plant similar to a daisy, with small flowers that are often used for tea and some 
        traditional medicines. Chamomile seeds can be acquired in grocery stores such as Star Market. </div>

          <p>My chamomile seeds finally germinated! Itâ€™s exciting to watch the green sprouts grow just a bit 
            taller every day. Seeds are considered to be alive, yet my perception of the organism changes when 
            it begins to sprout. With the realization of temporal space, and the passage of time presenting the 
            notion of growth, I have a tendency to watch these sprouts more than I did when they were dormant 
            beneath the soil. They linger on the mind. </p>
