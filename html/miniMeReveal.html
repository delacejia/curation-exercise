      <div class="flavor-text">The “Mini-Me” project is a milestone for the 2.007 Design and 
        Manufacturing class. Before working on their main robot, students create a smaller version 
        to get used to their tools and the feel of controlling a robot on the competition board. The 
        robot runs on two servos and is radio-controlled.</div>

          <p>The way the Mini-Me moves is so endearing! I drove it around and delivered chocolates 
            to friends in my pod. One of them told me it reminded them of a little dog. The static 
            collection of sheet metal and parts doesn’t mean much beyond a few hours of work during 
            lab time. Yet the movement of the object reminds me of life, the mannerisms of myself 
            reflected in the vehicle’s kinetic patterns. It lingers on the mind. </p>
