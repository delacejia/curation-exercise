      <div class="flavor-text">Milkis is a South Korean soft drink. The brand comes
         in a variety of flavors, such as orange, mango, peach, and apple to name a few. 
         Its name is derived from the dry milk included in the drink’s ingredients. </div>

          <p>There’s a face on this Milkis can! It looks like a man with an open mouth. 
            I removed the tab from the can before recycling it. Removing the tab revealed 
            this face, and it looked too cute to throw away. The appearance of the can left 
            an impression on me. It lingers on the mind.</p>
