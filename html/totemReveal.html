          <p>The two sides of the block read “祭祖平安符” (Jì zǔ píng'ān fú) and “贾姓图腾” 
            (Jiǎ xìng túténg). The first side means “Ancestral Peace Talisman”, while the 
            other reads “Jia Totem”. These words represent the act of visiting a specific 
            location to pay respect to your ancestors and your surname. This object holds 
            importance to me as it pertains to my name (Jia) in particular, and paying 
            respects to my family name. Without understanding the words on the talisman, 
            the object appears to just be some decorative block. But with the understanding 
            of its content, it reveals the aspect of life and the passage of life through 
            generations. It lingers on the mind. </p>
