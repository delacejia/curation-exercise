      <p> This exhibition, “They Linger on the Mind,” explores the characteristics of objects that are reminiscent 
        of living beings and the way our perception changes with their presence. Objects in the exhibition depict 
        the difference between before and after these characteristics are revealed, and the different ways these 
        characteristics emerge. Living characteristics are realized through the acquisition of an object’s name, 
        movements, appearance, comprehension, and temporal space. Why do we remember things that remind us of life? 
        What do these characteristics reveal about altruism and memory?
